# Summary of the business case

This file summarizes two projects:  

First one is front-end oriented and concerns the design and implementation of a mobile application on the model of an existing radio in web format: [radio-grenouille](http://www.radiogrenouille.com/.
This includes a work of realization of specifications, mock-up, database design, creation of component, link to an existing API that hosts the podcast and deployment inside a virtual machine. I
used React-Native framework along WSL environment for this project.

The second project is back-end oriented and deals with the management of manual invoicing in the company where I am working as a student : [Freepro](https://pro.free.fr/). 
This includes a rework of the intranet, a modification of the web service, creation of database functions and import integration into an accounting software. 
I used PHP, Perl and PostgreSQL along Linux environment for this project.
